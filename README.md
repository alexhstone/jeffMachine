Hi!  

Welcome to the jeffmachine!

The jeffmachine is a commandline text augmentation and analysis tool that can revolutionize the way you append .txt documents. 

You can use the jeffmachine to add "Jeff" to the end of any .txt file.  
jeffmachine will duplicate your input .txt file and make you a new one for your new jeff-i-fied message.   

You can also scan a provided text file for instances of "jeff" (case insensitve!) and the jeffmachine will let you know just how many there are! 

usage:  

to append your txt file with a little bit of jeff, use: ./jeffmachine yourFile.txt
to scan your provided text file for instances of jeff, use: ./jeffmachine yourFile.txt s



I included a sample file, sample.txt for you to try it out on.  Simply run ./jeffmachine sample.txt to see something really cool.
