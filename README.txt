Hi!  

Welcome to the jeffmachine!

The jeffmachine is a commandline text augmentation tool that can revolutionize the way you append .txt documents. 

You can use the jeffmachine to add "Jeff" to the end of any .txt file.  
jeffmachine will duplicate your input .txt file and make you a new one for your new jeff-i-fied message.   
It mostly works. 

usage:  ./jeffmachine yourFile.txt

I included a sample file, sample.txt for you to try it out on.  Simply run ./jeffmachine sample.txt to see something really cool.
